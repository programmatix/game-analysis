/*
This is a deck designed around Stick to the Plan and Primed for Action.  Designed to get a Thompson with lots of nice upgrades into our hands reliably.
Took this with Mark and Daisy through Drowned City Dec '25.

# Level 0

## This deck doesn't have much draw, has decent resources (for a Guardian), and has some heal.  It's designed for Mark, though would be easily adaptable for others.
