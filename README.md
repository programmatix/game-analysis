This project contains resources to construct and analyse decks for some popular card games.

It can also generate proxy decks, purely for home playtesting, and in case some cases because the content is out-of-print.  All copyrights are retained by the original game publishers - buy the game and support them!

See the README.md inside each game folder for more details.
